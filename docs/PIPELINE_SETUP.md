# Task 1: GitHub Actions Pipeline Implementation

## Technical Implementation
Implemented automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with the following components:

### Pipeline Structure (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Trigger: Pull requests to main branch
- Environment: Ubuntu latest, Python 3.8
- Quality checks: flake8 linting + pytest testing
- Dependencies: Automated installation from requirements files

### Validation Process
Conducted systematic testing to verify pipeline functionality:

**Linting validation**: Introduced intentional code style violation (missing spaces around operators) - pipeline correctly failed and blocked merge.

**Test validation**: Modified test assertion to incorrect expected value - pipeline caught the failure as expected.

**Branch protection**: Configured GitHub rules to enforce status checks before merge, preventing direct pushes to main branch.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
- Status check registration required manual configuration in branch protection rules
- Commit history management needed amend/force-push to maintain clean validation sequence  
- Branch protection interface required specific naming conventions for status check recognition

### Results
Pipeline successfully validates code quality and test coverage automatically. All quality gates functional and properly blocking problematic merges.
